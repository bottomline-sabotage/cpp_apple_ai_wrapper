# C++ Apple Intelligence Wrapper
Is a very simple and thrown together C++ wrapper for the macOS [Foundation Models API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels) (available on macOS 26) which allows Swift code to use Apple Intelligence. 

See a proper example in test.cpp

> [!CAUTION]
> This is ONLY supported on macOS Tahoe (which is currently in beta).
